Questions & Answers

1. Where it is said 'per day on eBay' does this mean it would run on its own on a daily basis or everyday the application is accessed?
The bot should be able to run daily and also pull previous records shown on eBay. For ex. 612 PS5’s sold on 12/24/20.

2. Under the Evaluation Header, where we have Speed, does this mean speed of execution of the bot or speed of completing the project
Both speed of the bot and the completion of the project. Although the speed of the code is the most important. 
3. Also i hope Web-Scraping technique is okay for this solution and we don't need access to eBay inhouse api's as this would take some time for approval.
Yes, web scraping is fine. Do not worry about getting access to eBay’s API.
